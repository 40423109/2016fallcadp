<h1>pyIGES</h1>

<p>
IGES geometry system implemented in python. This is part of a larger project
for my capstone project for `Mechanical Engineering` so heads up, it's no masterpiece of code.
</p>

<p>
No great disposition on how to use this library (yet), however have a look at
the examples and that should hopefully give an idea of how things are done. All
the geometry items that have currently been implemented can be found in IGESGeomLib.py
</p>

<p>
Further, as this library is being developed it hasn't been tested as to work
with other cad programs beyond an IGES viewer program. Work needs to be done to
ensure that it plays nicely with whatever program the IGES files are being imported to.
</p>

<p>
Finally note, IGES in this case is being used for surface modeling - I'm unaware
of programs that properly support the IGES constructive solid geometry items beyond b-rep geometry.

<h2>Depends On</h2>

<p>
There are few dependencies in this library, these are

<ol>Python 3.3.x (latest, x64)</ol>
<ol><a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy">Numpy</a> (latest, preferably with MKL)</ol>
<ol><a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy">SciPy</a> (latest, preferably with MKL)</ol>

The numpy and scipy packages are used in conjunction with the 'demo' geometry library.
